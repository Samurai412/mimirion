## ✨ Features

### 📝 Word Minimum on Open
Every time you open a note, Mimirion requires you to add a **set minimum number of words**.  
- **Local-first** – your data stays with you.  
- **No pasting** – deliberate friction that rewards genuine, evolving thought.  
- **“Anti-AI” by design** – built for human discipline.

### 💬 Self-Chat Mode
Inside each note are a few buttons, including **Chat**.  
Expecting to talk to Qwen3-8B? Hold your horses.  
Here, you’ll be chatting with the one and only… **yourself** — the old-fashioned way.

### 🧐 Critique Mode
A **peer-to-peer, turn-based feedback system** for thoughtful, structured notebook exchange and review.  
Perfect for building a vibrant, feedback-rich community.

### 🔄 Thought Relay
Up to **8 participants** can join a focused session, taking turns adding perspectives on a topic.  
Who knows… maybe the next big research paper will start here?
